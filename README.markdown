This plugin's behavior has been [made standard][patch] in [ruby-build][],
rendering it obsolete.

# Automatically link rbenv Ruby installs to readline on OS X

OS X ships with [editline][] rather than [readline][], and by default any Ruby
you compile on it will use the former rather than the latter.  This [rbenv][]
plugin's sole purpose is to tell [ruby-build][] to link to a [Homebrew][]
installed readline instead.

The particular problem this was created to solve was getting the ironically
named [pry-editline][] to consistently work across my Ruby installs.  This is
by no means the only reason to eschew editline.
